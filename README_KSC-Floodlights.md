## Features

* By default, it also includes automatic Sunrise (off) / Sunset (on) switching.

## REQUIRES the installation of Kerbal Konstructs

Using the **Kerbal Konstructs** Base Building Editor, you can edit, move, rescale, and add this tower to *ANY* base,
 created by, or for use with, Kerbal Konstructs.

## Changelog (changes made by Stone Blue):
* Renamed all objects for consistency/clarity, standard mod prefix for ease of MM patching/targeting, as well as easy organization and naming of any additional assets anyone may want to add to the mod.

* Fixed concavity of tower collider, converted it to a mesh collider for now

* Raised the light panel/collider/spotlight source further up the tower

* Tweaked the light panel size a little larger

* Adjusted source light properties, ie adding a *second* spotlight/per light, and upping the brightness, as well as adjusting the cone angle and throw distance
