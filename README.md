Click the towers to turn on the light. (The click-to-turn on/off, is a bit whacky with the automatic sunrise/sunset activated. It all still works, but you may have to click-wait a few seconds, or even try a quick dbl-click.)

## Features
* Can be manually turned on/off at ANY time, by clicking the tower.

* By default, it also includes automatic Sunrise (off) / Sunset (on) switching.

## REQUIRES the installation of Kerbal Konstructs
(NOT included in Stone Blue's update , and must be downloaded/installed seperately.)
[Kerbal Konstructs](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/151818-181-kerbal-konstructs-18115-15dec2019/)

Using the Kerbal Konstructs Base Building Editor, you can edit, move, rescale, and add this tower to *ANY* base,
 created by, or for use with, Kerbal Konstructs.

## Changelog (changes made by Stone Blue):
* Renamed all objects for consistency/clarity, standard mod prefix for ease of MM patching/targeting, as well as easy organization and naming of any additional assets anyone may want to add to the mod.

* Fixed concavity of tower collider, converted it to a mesh collider for now

* Raised the light panel/collider/spotlight source further up the tower

* Tweaked the light panel size a little larger

* Adjusted source light properties, ie adding a *second* spotlight/per light, and upping the brightness, as well as adjusting the cone angle and throw distance 

* Fixed the non-working emissive animation

* Downscaled the model in-game to default at 70%, but can easily be adjusted to any scale using the KK Base Building UI
